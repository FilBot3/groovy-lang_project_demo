# Groovy Example Project

## Overview

The layout of this project is taken from the Gradle Groovy Plugin documentation.
There they specify how they expect the project to be laid out by default and
how to override those defaults. However, doing the defaults is always preferable
to manually overriding everything every time.

I have a [`Makefile`](Makefile) just so that way I have a reference for what the
commands are when I look at this months down the road.

## Usage

### Gradle

```bash
gradle build
gradle run
```
